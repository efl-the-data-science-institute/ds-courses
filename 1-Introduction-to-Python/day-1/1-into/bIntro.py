# Hello World
# While small test programs have existed since the development of 
# programmable computers, the tradition of using the phrase 
# "Hello, World!" as a test message was influenced by an 
# example program in the seminal 1978 book The C Programming Language.
# The example program in that book prints "hello, world", 
# and was inherited from a 1974 Bell Laboratories internal memorandum 
# by Brian Kernighan, Programming in C: A Tutorial

# Chars are symbols.
# In Python, char is short for character.
# All characters in all languages can be represented.

# It doesn't matter what language, or computer platform it's on.
# Lets try to allocate a char to a variable and get the unicode number.
