# %% Chars are symbols.
# In Python, char is short for character.
# All characters in all languages can be represented.
# This representation is in the Unicode format.
# Unicode is a computer encoding methodology that assigns
# a unique number for every character.
# It doesn't matter what language, or computer platform it's on.
# Lets try to allocate a char to a variable and get the unicode number.
# @code: ord() Given a string representing one Unicode character

# %% Integer
# int (signed integer) − They are often called just integers or ints,
# are positive or negative whole numbers with no decimal point.




# Float (floating point real values, double) − Also called floats,
# they represent real numbers and are written with a
# decimal point dividing the integer and fractional parts.
# Floats may also be in scientific notation, with E
# or e indicating the power of 10.
# @code: We use a small d for double.














# Range of numbers
# Find the max values in the range of ints.
# @code: This module provides access to some
# variables used or maintained by the interpreter
# and to functions that interact strongly
# with the interpreter. It is always available.











# %% Boolean
# Boolean values are the two constant objects False and True.
# They are used to represent truth values (false or true).
